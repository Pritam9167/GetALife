      <h2>Mr. M.P.A. Nair</h2>

        " I would endeavour to make awareness amongst the people known to me, of the existence and 
            functions of ORBO, and the importance of offering useful organs
             atleast when it is realised that those are not useful to the body
              once the soul is departed so that more and more people involve in 
              donating organs". - Mr. M.P.A. Nair, brother of the recipient.

      <h2>Mrs. Meenu Aggarwal</h2>
      <p>
        I believe that god is always there. Expect His help and He will not fail you! If we had no faith in the 
        ultimate God, we would lose all hope. By organ donation we can help save
         lives of those who have lost all hope of living. The donor and his family's
          greatness and large heartedness have helped revive our faith in god 
          and mankind. It has encouraged me and my family to donate our organs
           to help save lives. 
        You may not be able to change the whole world, but even if you can change 
        your part of the world, life is worth living. Blessed are those who can give
         without remembering and take without forgetting ......... 
         Our lives live on forever in the lives that we touch and the best and 
         the most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen nor touched but are
          felt in the heart.
        
        Mrs. Meenu Aggarwal, an advocate by profession, underwent a kidney transplant in September 2002 at AIIMS. She is living a normal life now.
