                <h2>About Organ Donation</h2>
                <p>Organ donation is the process of giving an organ or a part of an organ to another person in need.
                    Organ Donation is the gift of an organ to a person with end stage organ disease and who needs a transplant.
                     The donated organ may be from a deceased donor or a living donor.Organ donation and transplantation is a surgical process
                      to replace a failing organ with a healthy one from someone else who doesn‚Äôt need it.
                      Organ donors are usually recently deceased people who either volunteered before their death to donate their organs afterward, or their family donated them on their behalf.
                       Organ recipients are usually people who are critically ill in the end stages of organ failure. 
                       Organ donation and transplantation can save these people‚Äôs lives.
                      But due to scarcity, unfortunately, not everyone who needs an organ transplant gets one in time.
                </p>
                <h2> What is Transplantation?</h2>
      
                <p>Surgical operation in which a failing or damaged organ in the human body is removed and replaced with a functioning one.</p>
                 
               <h2> Who can Pledge to Donate Organs?</h2>
                  <p>Any person not less than 18 years of age, who voluntarily authorizes the removal of any of his organ and/or tissue‚Ä¶</p>

        <h2>üß¨ Organ Matching Awareness</h2>
        <p class="intro-text">
          Not every donated organ can go to just anyone. Doctors need to match donors and recipients based on important medical factors. Here's how it works:
        </p>
      
        <div class="match-grid">
          <div class="match-card">
            <h3>ü©∏ Blood Type Matching</h3>
            <p>Donor and recipient must have compatible blood types (A, B, AB, O). O-negative is the universal donor!</p>
          </div>
      
          <div class="match-card">
            <h3>üîç Tissue Typing</h3>
            <p>Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) typing ensures immune system compatibility to reduce rejection risks.</p>
          </div>
      
          <div class="match-card">
            <h3>üìè Size Matching</h3>
            <p>Organs like lungs or liver must match the recipient's body size for successful transplantation.</p>
          </div>
      
          <div class="match-card">
            <h3>üß™ Crossmatch Test</h3>
            <p>Blood samples are tested to check if the recipient's body will accept the donor‚Äôs organ.</p>
